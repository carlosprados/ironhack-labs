# Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp

This repo contains all of the practical exercises I did during the Data Analytics Bootcamp @ [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en). The entire course lasted for 9 weeks with an additional career week. It was divided into 3 modules:

1. Git, Python and SQL;

2. Statistics and probability;

3. Machine Learning;
